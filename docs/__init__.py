Documentation
-------------

Documentation is done with `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_
and some helper functions coming with the software for more customization.
The folder that contains all the documentation is called ``docs``.
To compile, you first have to install Sphinx 1.1 or a better version and
pySPACE (see: :ref:`t_install`).
For creating the inheritance diagrams the
`Graphviz package <http://www.graphviz.org/>`_ is needed.
The documentation can be created by running ``make html`` in the ``docs`` directory
(therefore we have a ``Makefile`` in the ``docs`` folder).
To view the documentation open the ``index.html`` in the ``.build/html`` folder.

A compiled version of the documentation can be found
`on the git web page <http://pyspace.github.io/pyspace/index.html>`_.
