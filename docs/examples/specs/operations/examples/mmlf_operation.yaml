# This operation allows to conduct empirical evaluation in Reinforcement Learning
# scenarios. It is based on the MMLF software. MMLF is written in Python and can be
# obtained at http://mmlf.sourceforge.net/. Under this URL, documentation for the MMLF
# is also available that might be useful for understanding this operation.
#
# Further information about MMLF operations can be found in the corresponding tutorial
# "Empiricial Evaluations in Reinforcment Learning with pySPACE and MMLF"
# :ref:`docs.tutorials.tutorial_interface_to_mmlf`

# Determines how many independent runs will be conducted for each parameter setting

# Determines how many episodes the agent can learn

# Determines how many episodes the policy learned by an agent is evaluated
# This can be set to 1 for deterministic environments, but should b e set to
# larger values for stochastic environments

# In order to avoid method overfit (please take a look at the paper by
# Whiteson et al. "Generalized Domains for Empirical Evaluations in 
# Reinforcement Learning" for more details), an agent should be tested
# not only in one specific instantiation of an environment, but in several
# slightly different versions of an environment. These differences
# can be obtained by varying certain parameters of the environment. 
# This example will test each agent in four slightly different versions of
# the mountain car domain.
