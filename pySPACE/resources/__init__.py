""" Everything that can be input and output of pySPACE. Define your resources and run a mission!

Data is interfaced using :mod:`~pySPACE.missions`.

One can have a single small entity of data (of a special
:mod:`data type <pySPACE.resources.data_types>`), gather several data together to
one dataset of one recording and finally combine several recordings to a summary
to use them for a benchmarking or because they are of the same kind.

This can be patients data from different hospitals, EEG recordings with
a similar experiment but different subjects or days,
sensor recordings from different robots having the same set of sensors...
